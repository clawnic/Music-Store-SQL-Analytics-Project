## Questions and Queries
This project addresses multiple analytical questions related to the music store. Each question has a corresponding SQL query file located in the `questions/` directory. Some example questions include:
1. **What is the total revenue generated by each genre?**
2. **Which employee has the highest number of sales?**
3. **What are the top-selling albums in the last year?**
4. **Which country has the most customers?**

Each SQL file contains the query used to extract relevant data from the database.

## Database Schema
The database schema is visualized in the `schema/schema_image.png` file. It includes tables such as:
- Customers
- Employees
- Albums
- Genres
- Invoices

This schema outlines the relationships between different entities in the music store database.
